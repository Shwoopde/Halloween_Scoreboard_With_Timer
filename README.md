# Halloween_Scoreboard_With_Timer

This simple scoreboard has the option to add scores by 1,3, or 5 points at a time. 
It has a home and a guest board.

There is an option to add time in minutes and start the game which starts the timer.
If you double click the end game the time and score is reset.

That's it :)
